## Development Setup

For development with all dependencies:

```bash
# Create virtual environment

# Install in editable mode with dependencies
pip install -e .

# Or install from requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found

If commands aren't found after installation:

1. Make sure you're in the correct virtual environment
2. Check your PATH includes the Python scripts directory
3. Try reinstalling: `pip uninstall finance-papers && pip install -e .`

### Import errors

If you get import errors:

1. Make sure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Verify you're using Python 3.8 or higher: `python3 --version`

### Module not found

If you get "No module named 'src'":

1. Make sure you installed the package: `pip install -e .`
2. Don't run scripts directly from src/ directory when using installed commands
3. Use the console commands (e.g., `finance-papers`) instead of `python3 src/main.py`
